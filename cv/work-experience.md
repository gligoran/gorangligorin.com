## Creator and Developer

{:.muted .timespan .small}
November 2014 - June 2017

**Empire24.co** & **Linkr**

Empire24.co is brand I created as a platform for releasing digital services and products. The first product under this brand is a software as a service (SaaS) called Linkr. It enables users to create link with dynamic destinations and with it helps them better serve their audiences.

Front-ends of both are developed using HTML5, CSS3/SCSS and JavaScript to product an AngularJS Single Page Application (SAP). Back-ends are implemented using .NET Framework and C#, while the communication goes through a REST API developed using ASP.NET WebApi 2.

The entire solution is being developed using Visual Studio 2015 and tools like npm, bower and gulp are used to tie it all together.

Both Empire24.co and Linkr are hosted on Microsoft Azure as Websites and use Azure SQL for data storage. Git is used for source code management following the Git Flow principles. Continuous integration is done using Visual Studio Online (Team Services).

Most of my time at Adacta, I worked as a part of a team on a single project for a big client. The project was being implemented in NAV 2009. My responsibilities ranged from on-going tasks that included creating or altering reports to implementing and seeing through migration of data from client's old system to NAV 2009.

I was also a part of Adacta's support team for existing clients. I helped them when there were problems with existing implementations of NAV, implemented new features and migrated to newer NAV versions.

At my position I also learned a lot about how ERPs function in real-life environments.
