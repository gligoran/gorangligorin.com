## NicheCove.com

Niche Cove was my venture into internet marketing blogging. It was focused on creating niche websites, ranking them and seeing what works best. It also held income and expense reports that these websites produced.

## PiStats

{:.muted .timespan .small}
January 2013

[PiStats][] is a resource monitoring service for my Raspberry Pi. Data is periodically collected by a cronjob on the Pi itself and uploaded to a server. A server-side cronjob parses the collected data and coverts it a form ready to be displayed using graphs.

While new data is no longer being collected, the presentation layer of the project can still be found [here][pistats].

Skills used: *ASP.NET MVC 4, SQL, HTML5, CSS3 (LESS), Bootstrap, jQuery, Bash*
