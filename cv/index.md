I'm a young(-ish) developer trying to express his creative nature through programming languages. I love working with other people, but my self-driven personality also allows me to run my own projects. I'm always looking for new fields to expand my skill set and consider myself a fast-learner.

Here's the knowledge and experiences I've acquired so far:

- [Work experience](/cv/work-experience)
- [Projects](/cv/projects)
- [Skills](/cv/skills)
- [Education](/cv/education)
