Wednesday was a great day. First I passed another exam - only 4 left now - and straight afterwards we packed our swim shorts and headed off to [Planksee][]. That's a cable wake park in Austria located just across the boarder crossing with Slovenia at the Šentilj ([Google Maps][planksee-maps]).

Wakeboarding is one of my newer hobbies. I've skateboarded and snowboarded before and at the end of last August I tried wakeboarding as well. I was hooked instantly. The way the board glides across the water surface and the way you can take corners is just amazing.

It was my 4th time on a wakeboard. I was at Planksee two times last year and once at the [Orlando Watersports Complex][ows] during a USA road trip I went on with my friends.

The weather was just great on Wednesday and with it being a work day there were only a few people there. Which meant almost no queue time. It was just superb at first, but the lack of my fitness started to show quite fast. I haven't done any sports in quite a while now and this wakeboarding session burnt through my energy and stamina levels really fast. I wasn't even able to complete a full lap at the end. This just gives me one more reason to get into shape. And quick :smiley:

The real shock came yesterday though. I think there was not a muscle on and around my arms that wasn't sore. I couldn't even extend my arms fully. Oh and did I mention the sunburns? Got those too. But it was worth it. I started learning how to ride switch and did a few ollies. Buying my own board just jumped up quite a few places in my book. Got any suggestions?
