![Samsung Galaxy S2][sgs2]

So I finally got myself a decent phone. I'm not saying my old Nokia 5800 was that bad. Well actually it was a slow, single touch device with very little useful apps. It didn't even have proper threaded messaging for crying out loud. So that's why I've gone and gotten myself a brand new Samsung Galaxy S2, code name I9100 for all you tech geeks out there.

I'm really happy with for now, although I've still got a lot of apps to find and customize the hell out of it. And that's actually what I'm doing now. I found this WordPress app and I'm taking it for a test drive.

So I guess I'm done for now.
