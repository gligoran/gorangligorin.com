This YouTube clip has be sweeping the Internet lately. I'm not usually impressed by music played on mobile phones, but this is something else. This Atomic Tom's iPhone jam session on the subway is just AMAZING.

I was so impressed by this I went to their [MySpace][at-ms] page and they're apparently not a YouTube one hit wonder. There's a couple of good songs there. I encourage you to give them a hear.
