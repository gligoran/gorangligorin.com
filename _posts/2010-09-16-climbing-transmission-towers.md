These people - tower climbers - are just amazing. And amazingly brave. Climbing to a 500+ meters (1700+ feet) high towers and with next to none safety lines.

I could never do this myself as my high limit ends even before they actually start climbing. But if I were to do this job I'd bring a parachute and just jump off after I'm done.
