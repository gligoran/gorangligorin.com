These past 2 weeks I've been drowning in work. As I said in the beginning of July I'm doing [The Challenge 2010][tc10]. It's going OK for now. I'm a bit behind though. I'll be writing more about this in future posts.

I've also had an exam to deal with. And I still have a few of those left. 4 to be exact. According to my calendar I should be done with them a day or two before my birthday, 24th of September. I really hope it goes according to my plans and I pass all of them as they are starting to affect my future plans way too much. The problem is in not being able to get a routine in my daily life. I function way better when I have one and am a lot more productive as well. Help out and wish me luck :smiley:

I've also stopped jogging as it used up too much of my energy and I couldn't study. I haven't given up though. I'll be taking it back up as soon as I'm done with school stuff. I actually miss jogging and I feel it in my legs. They get very jittery from time to time and I can hardly sit still when that happens.

As you can see school has (again) taken over my life and I really just want to be over with it. The last thing it's been messing with is my writing. As you can see this is my first post in 2 weeks. And it's not for the lack of ideas. I have about 4 draft post on my posts list. I make those so I don't forget any good ideas I get. And I'll have to make a few more for the ones that are still in my head.

I'll probably take the next few hours for writing and hopefully I'll pump out some good content. I'll post these over the next few weeks. So stay tuned.
