This song is just amazing. I've been listening to it over the past few days and I still can not get enough. Especially the _para para pa pa..._ part gets me. The song is a part of their Plans album.

Here are the [lyrics][smb-lyrics] as well, because if you're like me you'll be signing along in a jiffy :smiley:
